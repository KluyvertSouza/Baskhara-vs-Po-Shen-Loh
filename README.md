# Baskhara vs Po-Shen Loh
I compared the application in Python of the traditional method for solving high school sad and the Po-Shen Loh method. The exercise was very interesting, because algebraically (obviously) the results, as expected, are exactly the same.

I used the values ​​a = 1, b = 5 and c = -2, but it could be any. The delta value was 33.
